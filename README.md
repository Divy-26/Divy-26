## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The objective was to create a hotel management system application that could be accessed using a mobile device while using Flask for web development, 
MySQL for organizing the database, and Heroku for hosting. 
These technologies were chosen due to their simplicity for combining frontend and backend and Flask while MySQL was chosen for its reliability for relational databases. 
Heroku was chosen to help streamline the deployment method for both the desktop and mobile versions of the application.
In the course of the research phase, it was also necessary to assess the user needs, namely registration, authorization, administrative tasks, and control over room availability. 
Concerning data security the practices of the industry have been reviewed to check the standard of the app for password storing. 
Password encryption was done to SHA-256 to meet standards in preserving sensitive data security.
